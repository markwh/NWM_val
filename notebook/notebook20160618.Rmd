Looking at NWM output via the [tethys app](https://apps.hydroshare.org/apps/nwm-data-explorer/files_explorer/). 

Starting with short range/20160617

What's the difference between:

1. channel
2. land
3. reservoir
4. terrain?

Appears to be hourly--t00z through t23z

Downloaded file "nwm.t00z.short_range.channel_rt.f004.conus.nc_georeferenced.nc"

Now open with Panoply

- OK, this only allows plotting?
- unclear whether this will be useful. 

Try instead using R package

```{r}
install.packages("RNetCDF")
install.packages("ncdf4")
install.packages("ncdf.tools")
```

Hmm. Problem with udunits.

```{r}
install.packages("udunits2")
```


"ncdf.tools" is built upon "RNetCDF" to simplify workflows. 

```{r}
library(RNet)
```
